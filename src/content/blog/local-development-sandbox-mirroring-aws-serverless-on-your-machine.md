While our [PR deployment system](https://metaduck.com/deploying-pull-requests-a-complete-aws-stack-for-every-pr-/) creates isolated AWS environments for every pull request, developers need a fast, reliable local setup for day-to-day development. That's where our local sandbox comes inâ€”a lightweight simulation of our serverless infrastructure that runs entirely on your machine.

This isn't about spinning up Docker containers or managing complex orchestration. Instead, we've built a simple, fast local development environment that mirrors our AWS setup as closely as possible while keeping things lightweight and developer-friendly.

## The Philosophy: Simplicity Over Complexity

When we designed our local development setup, we had a few key principles in mind:

- **Fast startup times** - No waiting for containers to build or services to initialize
- **Minimal resource usage** - Runs efficiently on any developer's machine
- **Close to production** - Simulates the serverless architecture we use in AWS
- **Easy debugging** - Full access to logs, breakpoints, and hot reloading
- **No Docker required** - Eliminates container management complexity

The result is a development environment that starts in seconds and provides a realistic simulation of our production infrastructure.

## The Architecture: How It All Fits Together

Our local sandbox consists of two main components:

1. **Architect Sandbox** - Simulates AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS and S3
2. **Vite Dev Server** - Serves the frontend with hot module replacement

These work together to create a seamless development experience where your frontend code runs on Vite (port 3000) and your backend code runs in Architect's sandbox (port 3333), with API calls seamlessly proxied between them.

### The Backend: Architect Sandbox

Architect's sandbox is the star of the show. It takes your `app.arc` fileâ€”the same one that defines your AWS infrastructureâ€”and creates local equivalents of all your serverless services.

```bash
# Start the sandbox
cd apps/backend
../../node_modules/.bin/sandbox
```

When you run this command, Architect:

- **Starts local Lambda functions** that mirror your AWS Lambda functions
- **Creates a local API Gateway** that handles HTTP routing
- **Spins up local DynamoDB** for database operations
- **Provides local S3** for file storage
- **Sets up WebSocket support** for real-time features

The beauty is that your code doesn't know the difference. The same Lambda functions that run in AWS also run locally, just in a different environment.

### The Frontend: Vite Dev Server

Our frontend runs on Vite, which provides lightning-fast hot module replacement and development server capabilities. The key to making this work seamlessly is the proxy configuration in our `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
const serverOptions: UserConfig["server"] = {
  port: 3000,
  proxy: {
    "/api": {
      target: "http://localhost:3333",
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
    "/graphql": {
      target: "http://localhost:3333",
      changeOrigin: true,
    },
  },
  // ... other config
};
```

This proxy configuration means that when your frontend makes a request to `/api/auth/signin` or `/graphql`, Vite automatically forwards it to the Architect sandbox running on port 3333. Your frontend code doesn't need to know about different URLs for different environmentsâ€”it just works.

## Environment Configuration: Bridging Local and Cloud

One of the trickiest parts of local development is managing environment variables and configuration. Our sandbox environment setup handles this elegantly.

### Dynamic Port Allocation

Since we might run multiple sandbox instances (for testing), we need to avoid port conflicts. Our `sandbox-env.ts` handles this:

```typescript
// configure Architect's ports
const newPorts = await getPorts(workerId, 6);
const [portBase, eventsPort, tablesPort, s3Port, arcPort] = newPorts;

const ports: Record<string, string> = {
  _arc: arcPort,
  http: portBase,
  tables: tablesPort,
  events: eventsPort,
  s3: s3Port,
};
```

Each sandbox instance gets its own set of ports, ensuring they can run simultaneously without conflicts.

### AWS Credentials and Local Services

For services that need AWS credentials (like S3 operations), our sandbox can use your local AWS configuration:

```typescript
const getAwsCredentials = async () =>
  (await getAwsCredentialsFromIni()) ?? getAwsCredentialsFromEnv();
```

This means you can use your AWS CLI credentials for local development, or the sandbox can run without them for most operations.

### Environment Variables

The sandbox sets up a comprehensive environment that mirrors production:

```typescript
const appConfig: Record<string, string | undefined> = {
  PORT: portBase,
  ARC_WSS_URL: `ws://localhost:${portBase}/`,
  NEXTAUTH_URL: new URL("api/auth", baseUrl(portBase)).href,
  APP_URL_BASE: `http://localhost:${portBase}`,
  VITE_WS_URL: `ws://localhost:${portBase}/ws`,
  // ... many more
};
```

This ensures that your application behaves the same way locally as it does in production.

## The Development Workflow

### Starting the Sandbox

Our `sandbox.sh` script orchestrates the entire development environment:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Build the backend
pnpm build:backend &

# Optionally start SSR server
if [ -n "${SSR:-}" ]; then
  nx serve server-side-rendering &
fi

# Start Architect sandbox
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 ../../node_modules/.bin/sandbox
```

This script:

1. **Builds the backend** TypeScript code
2. **Optionally starts SSR** if needed
3. **Launches the Architect sandbox** with proper environment variables
4. **Handles cleanup** when you stop the process

### Hot Reloading and Development

The beauty of this setup is that you get the best of both worlds:

- **Frontend hot reloading** via Vite - changes to React components appear instantly
- **Backend hot reloading** via Architect - Lambda function changes are reflected immediately
- **Full debugging capabilities** - you can set breakpoints in both frontend and backend code

### Testing Integration

Our sandbox is also used for automated testing. The `sandbox.ts` file provides a programmatic interface for starting and stopping sandbox instances:

```typescript
function start(env: Env, config: Config): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Start sandbox process
    child = spawn(
      sandboxExecFilePath,
      ["--disable-symlinks", "--confirm", "--port", `${config.apiPort}`],
      {
        stdio: "pipe",
        env,
        cwd: sandboxWorkingDirPath,
      }
    );

    // Wait for startup
    child!.stdout!.on("data", (d) => {
      if (output.indexOf("Sandbox startup scripts ran") >= 0) {
        started = true;
        setTimeout(() => resolve(), 2000);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

This allows our test suite to spin up isolated sandbox instances for each test, ensuring complete isolation between test runs.

## What Works (and What Doesn't)

### What Works Well

- **HTTP API endpoints** - All your Lambda functions work exactly as they do in AWS
- **DynamoDB operations** - Local DynamoDB provides the same interface
- **S3 file operations** - Local S3 handles file uploads and storage
- **WebSocket connections** - Real-time features work locally
- **Authentication flows** - OAuth and JWT authentication work seamlessly
- **GraphQL queries** - All your GraphQL resolvers function normally

### What's Different

- **Performance characteristics** - Local DynamoDB and S3 are faster than AWS equivalents
- **Scaling behavior** - No auto-scaling or cold starts locally
- **Service limits** - No AWS service limits or throttling
- **Network latency** - Everything runs on localhost, so network calls are instant

### What Requires AWS

- **External AWS services** - If your code calls other AWS services (like SES for email), you'll need AWS credentials
- **Third-party integrations** - Services that require specific AWS configurations
- **Advanced features** - Some AWS-specific features might not have local equivalents

## Best Practices for Local Development

### Environment Management

Keep your local environment variables in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_key_here
JWT_SECRET=local_development_secret
```

This keeps sensitive data out of your codebase while providing the configuration your app needs.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check sandbox logs** - The sandbox outputs detailed logs for all requests
2. **Use browser dev tools** - Network tab shows proxied requests
3. **Set breakpoints** - You can debug both frontend and backend code
4. **Monitor ports** - Ensure no port conflicts between services

### Performance Optimization

- **Use watch mode** - `WATCH=true pnpm sandbox` for automatic rebuilding
- **Disable unnecessary services** - Only start what you need for your current task
- **Monitor resource usage** - The sandbox is lightweight but can accumulate memory over time

## When to Use Local vs. Cloud

### Use Local Sandbox For

- **Day-to-day development** - Fast iteration and debugging
- **Feature development** - Building new functionality
- **Bug fixes** - Isolating and fixing issues
- **Code reviews** - Testing changes before committing

### Use Cloud PR Deployments For

- **Integration testing** - Testing with real AWS services
- **Performance testing** - Understanding real-world performance
- **Stakeholder demos** - Sharing working features with non-technical team members
- **Production-like testing** - Final validation before merging

## The Bottom Line

![Deploying PRs](/images/blog/astronaut-wonderful.jpg)

Our local sandbox strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality. It's not a perfect replica of AWSâ€”and it doesn't need to be. Instead, it provides a fast, reliable development environment that lets you focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

The key insight is that you don't need Docker containers or complex orchestration to have a great local development experience. Sometimes the simplest solutionâ€”running services directly on your machine with smart proxyingâ€”is the most effective.
