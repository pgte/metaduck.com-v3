> _Looking back, taking stock, and getting ready for what’s next._

I recently turned **50**.
And, not long before that, I had to close **[Decipad](https://www.decipad.com)** - a startup I co-founded and poured myself into for the past few years.

It feels like the right moment to pause and take stock - to look back, and to look ahead.

I’ve been working in this industry since **1997**, one year before finishing my Software Engineering degree.
That’s **28 years ago** - which feels both like a blink and a lifetime.

If I’m honest, I’ve often felt that I was **following the current** rather than steering it.

- I joined the _Distributed Systems_ unit at Link Consulting because a friend recruited me.
- I became **CTO at Clarity Europe**, a FinTech startup, because a professor invited me.
- Later, I found myself working for a **bank** simply because the company I was with got acquired by one.

I wasn’t complaining - I was learning a lot - but I wasn’t really choosing my own path either.

### Taking the Helm

![Madeira](/images/blog/madeira.png)

That changed in **2004**, when I decided to take control of my destiny.
I moved back home to **Madeira island** and, since there was no real tech industry to join, I started my own company.

I fell, almost by accident, into the **tourism industry** - the heartbeat of Madeira - and learned how hard and beautiful building something from scratch can be.
But when the business went bankrupt around 2010, I had to start over again.

This time, I decided to work **remotely**. I joined an education company that was doing good work and - just as importantly - needed the help.

Around then, I discovered **Node.js**.

That discovery changed everything.

I started creating open-source projects, writing, and sharing what I was learning.
For the first time in a long time, I felt I was **at the helm again** - creating, not just reacting.

That led to my first real adventure in the cloud world: I was hired by one of the first **Node.js PaaS** providers.

### From Consulting to Open Source

Then a good friend invited me to join his consulting company in London.
We built systems for **Education**, **Retail**, **Publishing**, **Finance** - you name it.

It was great work, but I realized I didn’t just want to **build for others**.
I wanted to **build something of my own** again.

So, I quit.

Not long after, another friend invited me to join **[Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai)** to work on **[IPFS](https://ipfs.tech)** - a bold, open-source project building the foundations for a **decentralized web**.

It was a dream: hard distributed-systems problems, a massive mission, and a team of brilliant minds.

But the space around us shifted. The Web3 gold rush brought too many opportunists and too little meaning.
Combined with hands-off leadership, I started feeling disconnected from the mission.

So, once again, I quit.

### Building for the Public Good

After that, I took a breath.
I spent some time helping out at the **local university**, doing small research projects.

One of those projects quickly evolved into a mission-critical system during the **first Covid lockdown** - a platform that helped **reopen Madeira’s borders safely**.

We built and deployed it in **three weeks** - just me and two part-time, inexperienced interns - to support health authorities in a region that depends deeply on tourism.

It worked. But the experience also opened my eyes to the **public sector’s pace and politics**, and I burned out from the frustration of command hierarchies and media-driven priorities.

Still, it left me with a fascination for how **software and public good** intersect - how open-source and participatory processes could reshape how we build for society.

Sadly, few seemed interested in real change, and my enthusiasm fizzled out.

### The Decipad Chapter

Then came **[Decipad](https://www.decipad.com)**.
In 2021, while searching for what to do next, a good friend shared an idea that instantly clicked.

Four and a half years later, after a wild, intense ride of building, learning, growing, and shipping, we had to shut it down.

It hurt. But it also felt like the closing of a chapter that taught me **everything** - about leadership, product, teams, markets, and most of all, about myself.

We shared a bit about that here:

### Looking Ahead

Now, as I look ahead, I know I want to do something that matters deeply - in **health** or **education**.

I’ve been exploring the field of **[Computational Psychiatry](https://metaduck.com/tags/computational-psychiatry/)**, curious about how technology might help us understand and support mental health in more human, data-informed ways.

At the very least, I want to connect with people who **care about meaningful work** - people building things that improve lives, not just metrics.

If that resonates with you, I’d love to connect:

Here’s to whatever comes next -
because I have a feeling the best part of the journey is still ahead.
